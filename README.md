I will tackle some thing on this document for clarifying purposes:
1- The representation of the author as a profile will be implemented as a lookup on a contact from the Post custom object.
2- A component similar (but more complete) to the PublicationLists component will be used to display the posts on the post tab.
3- The lists displayed at the writers tab are for the use of the writer, this way he or she can manage his or her posts, with the option of discard the post at any phase of the publication cycle (draft, submitted for review, ready to publish)
4- The idea also is to have another list below of the already displayed ones for reviewing, in case the writer is also the manager of another user, he or she can review the posts and approve them following the same schema of the lists presentes above.
